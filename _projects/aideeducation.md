I joined AideEducation in March 2023 as a developer and technical consultant for the teams. My main goal is to significantly improve productivity in administrative tasks by developing a user-friendly solution for content management. At my arrival, the website was running on an outdated barebone version of PHP, with hardcoded content and security breaches in the source code. With a scarce technical department, the organization had to wait weeks (if not months) to implement any content updates.

Currently, I'm leading the complete technical and visual overhaul of the organization's website. The solution itself is a Next.js application, managed by a decoupled headless CMS (Payload). We're also working on updating the outdated infrastructure of our VPS.
