GoneRank is a passion project around football and data visualization. A community platform of users rating the performances of their favorite players. The main goal is to provide a centralized and long-lasting solution for fans to track, compare and share their opinions through a tailored and rich analytical interface. Who was your highest rated player this season? In which competition did he shine the most? Against which team did he struggle? Did the team improve compare to last year? etc...

I'm currently working on a new version that you can follow **[here](https://github.com/kevscript/gonerank-new)**, applying what I've learned from the mistakes (mainly GraphQL) I made on the current version. Trying out a Prisma + Kysely combo.

At some point I'd like to automate the process of creating new entries (matches, players, teams,...) by implementing a scraping system running on a cron job.
