GoneRank is a passion project around football and data visualization. A community platform of users rating the performances of their favorite players. The main goal is to provide a centralized and long-lasting solution for fans to track, compare and share their opinions through a tailored and rich analytical interface. Who was your highest rated player this season? In which competition did he shine the most? Against which team did he struggle? Did the team improve compare to last year? Which defensive player was awarded the most MOTM trophies by the community, in away games, of 2022? etc...

I'm currently working on a new version, trying to automate the process of creating new entries (matches, players, teams,...) by implementing a scraping system running on a cron job.
